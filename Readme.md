
 1. There is no largest prime number.  
contradiction:  
There is a largest prime number, as (m_n). This means that the list of prime numbers is finite:  

m_1, m_2, ..., p_n

largest prime number = m_1 + m_2... + m_n + 1

"largest prime number" is one more than the product of all the primes.  


Now, two possibilities:
1.1. (Q) is prime — but that’s a contradiction, since we assumed (p_n) is the largest prime.
1.2. (Q) is not prime — which means it has a prime factor not in the list. Contradiction again!

Thus, there can’t be a largest prime number. 



 2. (sqare root of 3) is irrational.  
contradiction:  
square root of 3 is rational.  
So, we can write it as:
sqare root of 3 = a/b

square both sides = a^2 = 3b^2

This meabns a^2 is a multiple of 3, meaning a itself must be divisible by 3

Let a = 3k for some integer k. Substituting into the equation:

(3k)^2 = 3b^2 
9k^2 = 3b^2 
b^2 = 3k^2

b^2 is divisible by 3, so b must also be divisible by 3.  

Now both a and (b) are divisible by 3, contradicting our assumption that a/b was in simplest form.  
Thus, square root of 3 is irrational.

 3. If n^2 is even, then n must be even.  
contradiction:  
n is odd, but n^2 is even.

Since (n) is odd, we can write it as:

n = 2k + 1  where k is an integer

Now, let’s square it:

n^2 = (2k + 1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1

This is odd because it’s of the form (2m + 1), where (m) is an integer.  

This contradicts the assumption that n^2 is even. Thus, if n^2 is even, n must be even. 



 4. The sum of an irrational number and a rational number is irrational.  
contradiction:  
There is an irrational number b and a rational number y such that their sum is rational.  

b + y = q where q is rational


Rearrange the equation:

b = q - r

Since both q and r are rational, their difference q - r is also rational.

This means b is rational, contradicting our assumption that b is irrational. Thus, the sum of an irrational and a rational number is always irrational. 



 5. There is no smallest positive rational number.  
contradiction:  
There is a smallest positive rational number, say r.  

Since r is positive and rational, we can write it as:

r = ab where a and b are positive integers




s = r/2 = a/2b

This s is also a positive rational number, and it is smaller than r. This contradicts the assumption that r was the smallest positive rational number.

Thus, there is no smallest positive rational number.
